# Merrill Python Data Study Hall

This is the git repo for Merrill Python Data Study Hall.  

Here, you'll find:

* Deadline for completion of current DataCamp course.
* An agenda for our weekly meetups.  
* Data sets and code files for weekly exercises.
* General information about the group.

## DataCamp Deadlines

You should plan to complete a new DataCamp course in the [Data Scientist with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) track every two weeks. You should get an "assignment" notification through DataCamp.

**Current course (Due Oct. 23, 2017):** [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)

**Previous course (Due Oct. 9, 2017):** [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

## Weekly meetup agendas

If you can attend in-person, this is what we'll work on.
If you can't attend in-person, use this agenda to complete these activities on your own time.   

On weeks when a new DataCamp module is due, we'll jointly work together on an exercise to reinforce the online learning.  On the other weeks, we'll use the time to help each other work through the online modules, learn tools to help us be better programmers (like GitHub), or plan future exercises.

**Upcoming week agenda:** [Week 3](weekly-agenda/week-3/week-3.md)

**Previous week agenda:** [Week 1](weekly-agenda/week-2/week-2.md)

## Files, How-to guides for weekly exercises

On weeks where we work on joint exercises, this is where you'll find files and instructions to help you complete the exercises.

**Upcoming week exercises:** Week 2 TBD

**Previous week exercises:** [Week 1](exercises/week-1)
