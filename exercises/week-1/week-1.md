# Week 1 - Merrill Python Data Study Hall
#### Oct. 9, 2017
#### Builds on first course in [Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) track: [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).

## Agenda
1. Openers
  * Is everyone in the DataCamp group?
  * Is everyone in the Slack channel?
  * Is everyone in the habit of checking Slack, or would it be useful to send a daily email digest to get you all in the habit?
  * Even during in-person meetings, let's get in the habit of posting questions/comments to Slack channel.  This helps people who can't make it stay involved.
2. Study Hall Structure
  * How does completing a new course every other week sound? Too slow or too aggressive?
  * How should we use our in-person sessions?  A proposal: on a week a course is scheduled for completion, we work collaboratively on a mini-project to reinforce coursework.  For off-weeks, use in-person time to work on courses, learn helpful coding tools (like GitHub), and discuss/prepare future mini-projects.
3. Installing Python 3
 * There are two main versions of Python in use: Python 2 and Python 3.
 * We will use Python 3. To make sure you have the latest version of Python 3, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), double click on the downloaded package, and follow the steps.
 * Test that it's installed.  Open "Terminal" on a Mac or "Command Prompt" on Windows. Type "python3" to enter the python environment.  Try printing "Hello, World" by typing `print("Hello,World")`.   

4.  Running python 3 from the command line.  
5.  Installing Anaconda.
6.  Running Spyder IDE.
7.  Using script files in Spyder IDE.
8.  Reading in data using pandas, exercise
