# Week 2 exercise

Today's exercise is designed to get you comfortable using pandas to find the answers to common questions by analyzing state of Maryland employee salary data.  

To get started, download the [csv that contains the data](data/state-cy-2016.csv).  Then download this python file ([maryland-salary.py](files/maryland-salary.py)). Put them in a folder on your local machine and open it in Anaconda > Spyder.

A description of the data, guides to really helpful cheat sheets and tutorials, and the questions you will answer, are in maryland-salary.py as comments. If you get stuck, feel free to refer to the answers [maryland-salary-answers.py](files/maryland-salary-answers.py)
